# 📚 Agenda Assignment Tracker — Academic Planning Web App (Planning Phase)

**Agenda Assignment Tracker** is a personal project I'm currently planning — it's a web app built to help manage academic and project-based assignments in a way that's visual, practical, and easy to stick with. The idea is to log assignments with due dates, track progress, and break things down day-by-day so you're never overwhelmed last minute. Eventually, it should feel like a smart digital agenda that works how I wish most to-do apps would.

## Developer Notes

This project is something my girlfriend proposed as an ask for juggling assignments, side projects, and trying to stay organized. I want it to feel clean, motivational, and help spread work across time without micromanaging users. Everything will be modular to allow for expansion later (like AI suggestions or smart sorting). Starting simple — scaling smart.
